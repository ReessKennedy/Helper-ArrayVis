# ArrayVis


## What ‚ö°
Output a compact, text-based view of any array where all keys are shown but no values and rows are limited to just one with a summary of total number of rows. 
## Why ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
If you work with arrays or apis you need a method to quickly understand just he structure of the array and keys. Using `print_r` or `var_dump` can be confusing as it shows you everything. 
## How üìã
Just pass any array to the function and voila!

```php
ArrayVis($thearray)
```

## Before and After
It just returns the keys and not values.

                                        (
